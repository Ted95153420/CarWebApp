# CarWebApp
Sort of like gas buddy, but for car listed vs sold prices.
Goal is for a searchable database of SOLD cars - you can see what dealer listed them, how much for and how much 
the vehicle sold for amongst various other data a car shopper will find useful in the buying process.

## Prerequisites / getting set up

Just download the stuff you need (vscode / .Net Core). I have explained how to do this [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k873eektwkw "Ted Talks")
