goal of this chapter

- to demonstrate how asp.net core can serve up static files.

- reference sean wildermuths tutorial - say that 
    app.UseDefaultFiles();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

can be used 'out of the box' - i.e no red squigglys using VS Code 1.24. In wildermuths tutorial he had
to add a reference etc...

BIG POINT - the order of execution of UseDefaultFiles(), UseStaticFiles is important, otherwise you need to specify
'index.html' in URL

 also say that a HTML 5 template is provided by VS Code - just add the file then start typing <!DOCTYPE html>
demonstrate this!!
