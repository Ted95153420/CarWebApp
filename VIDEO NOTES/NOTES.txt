goal of this chapter

- to demonstrate how asp.net core can serve up static files and to show a tiny bit of Java Script

- reference sean wildermuths tutorial - say that 
    app.UseDefaultFiles();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

can be used 'out of the box' - i.e no red squigglys using VS Code 1.24. In wildermuths tutorial he had
to add a reference etc...

BIG POINT - the order of execution of UseDefaultFiles(), UseStaticFiles is important, otherwise you need to specify
'index.html' in URL

 also say that a HTML 5 template is provided by VS Code - just add the file then start typing <!DOCTYPE html>
demonstrate this!!


BOWER
   - in days of old (ASP.Net 4 and below) you would use nuget to install the JQuery Library
   - dont do this! use Bower! this is the way forward and in line what the web dev community actually use.
   - think of Bower as a package manager
   - (first of all, install node js by going to their website https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - you need node.js because bower is written in Node.js (I downloaded version 10.11.0 of Node.js installer, 6.4.1
      of npm)
   - use https://maxo.blog/adding-bower-to-asp-net-project-visual-studio-code/ for reference
   -when bower was installed I got the impression it is not really used anymore - see 'OnBowerInstall.jpg'
