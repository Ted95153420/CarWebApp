Goal of this chapter is to enable MVC.

Views/Home/Inndex_Orig_Renamed.cshtml is the original index file (auto generated when an MVC
app was created - I kept this because there are some useful links in there).

-so i enabled MVC by altering Startup.cs
-basically, services.AddMVC is ALREADY added to the ConfigureServices Method
-just make sure that app.usemvc is added in the configure method - this is where routing is set up

-ISSUES Encountered.
- _ViewStart.cshtml has Layout = _Layout
-the above uses _Layout.cshtml as a layout file - the trouble is I dont want this right now 
-if I do Layout = null or Layout = "", then the css isnt applied to Views/Home/Index.cshtml
-learn more abut razr and talk about resolution in my next video.

2nd October 2018.
  _Layout.cshtml needed modifying. It is already referencing my .css and .js files :-
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
  <script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>

  all i did was just comment out the parts of the _Layout file I do not want to see.
  not ideal but this isnt a razor tutorial. 
  END RESULT :site looks like it should and is using MVC
  Site Loads with errors.
