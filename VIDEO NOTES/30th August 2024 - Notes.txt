Revisited this project for the first time since around 2019. 

Of Huge significance are

Project was using .net core 2.2 which was long since end of life'd  - upgraded to .NET 8. To do this I needed to install 
the .Net Upgrade Assistant extension

Automapper Nuget package I was using was deprecated. I needed to upgrade to AutoMapper 13.0.1

Because of said upgrades, I saw numerous compilation errors. The most significant was the code in Startup.cs 
I needed to Migrate to use endpointRouting in short, we DO NOT use this anymore (the UseMvc is NOT supported whilst using EndpointRouting 
- to get around this I would have had to of disabled Endpointrouting using MvcOptions.EnableEndPOintRouting = false' - which would have been 
ok, but its really not the way forward. )

 app.UseMvc(config =>
            {
                config.MapRoute(
                    name: "Default",
                    template: "{controller}/{action}/{id?}",
                    defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" }
                );
            });
			
SO, I had 2 options. I went with option 2.


Option 1: Disable Endpoint Routing

Add the following line to the ConfigureServices method:

services.AddMvc(options => options.EnableEndpointRouting = false);

This will allow you to continue using UseMvc.

Option 2: Migrate to Endpoint Routing

Replace the UseMvc call with the Endpoint Routing equivalent:

app.UseRouting();
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllers();
});

This will migrate your application to use Endpoint Routing.

Choose one of the options and update the code accordingly. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance
