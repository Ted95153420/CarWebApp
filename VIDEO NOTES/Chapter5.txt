USING LAYOUTS and Hooking up to an API

Talk about what you get for 'free' when you create a new MVC project specifically
_ViewStart.cshtml which specifies the layout file for all of the website.
_Layout.cshtml for the general stuff and use of @RenderBody as a 'place holder' so content
can be 'injected'

23rd October 2018
   Refactored _Layout.cshtml - no longer boiler plate that comes with project but contains the general 
   layout for this web application. (basically moced the header and footer out of Index.cshtml and placed in 
   _Layout.cshtml, then added an @RenderBody to _Layout.cshtml so it 'knows' where to render page specific
   content)
