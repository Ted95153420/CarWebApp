USING LAYOUTS and Hooking up to an API

Talk about what you get for 'free' when you create a new MVC project specifically
_ViewStart.cshtml which specifies the layout file for all of the website.
_Layout.cshtml for the general stuff and use of @RenderBody as a 'place holder' so content
can be 'injected'

23rd October 2018
   Refactored _Layout.cshtml - no longer boiler plate that comes with project but contains the general 
   layout for this web application. (basically moced the header and footer out of Index.cshtml and placed in 
   _Layout.cshtml, then added an @RenderBody to _Layout.cshtml so it 'knows' where to render page specific
   content)

28th October 2018
    Added Contact Page - site.js is not loading and therefore not changing the welcome message. Fix these
    reference errors before continuing!

31stOctober 2018 - hint of a clue. site.js is now loading. I changed the reference in index.cshtml
    from    : <script type="text/javascript" src="~wwwroot/js/site.js">
    to      : <script type="text/javascript" src="~/js/site.js">

    and this worked just fine, trouble is, doent work when I use the ~/path... in the _Layout page.
    MIGHT be that I dont have a 'Development' environment set up. explore this but dont waste too much time....
