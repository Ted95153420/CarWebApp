USING LAYOUTS and Hooking up to an API

Talk about what you get for 'free' when you create a new MVC project specifically
_ViewStart.cshtml which specifies the layout file for all of the website.
_Layout.cshtml for the general stuff and use of @RenderBody as a 'place holder' so content
can be 'injected'

23rd October 2018
   Refactored _Layout.cshtml - no longer boiler plate that comes with project but contains the general 
   layout for this web application. (basically moced the header and footer out of Index.cshtml and placed in 
   _Layout.cshtml, then added an @RenderBody to _Layout.cshtml so it 'knows' where to render page specific
   content)

28th October 2018
    Added Contact Page - site.js is not loading and therefore not changing the welcome message. Fix these
    reference errors before continuing!

31stOctober 2018 - hint of a clue. site.js is now loading. I changed the reference in index.cshtml
    from    : <script type="text/javascript" src="~wwwroot/js/site.js">
    to      : <script type="text/javascript" src="~/js/site.js">

    and this worked just fine, trouble is, dosen/t work when I use the ~/path... in the _Layout page.
    MIGHT be that I dont have a 'Development' environment set up. explore this but dont waste too much time....

2nd November 2018
    Above comment (from 31st November) not valid. It was nothing to do with the Development environment
    It was due to the fact I didnt have bower set up properly. A quick read of 
    https://www.loginradius.com/engineering/how-to-use-bower-to-install-bootstrap/ solved the problem for me.
    SANITY CHECK :-
    -demonstrate the fact you can delete from wwwroot/lib, then just do a restore using bower install
    after doing the above, I'd expect 'bootstrap' 'jQuery' and 'underscore' folders underneath the lib folder.
    does this happen? If so why? (when i type the 'bower list' command, there is no mention of jQuery)

2nd November 2018
    Worth a mention that I used Tag helpers in the links (in _Layout.cshtml)
    <a asp-controller="home" asp-action="Index">Home</a>
    <a asp-controller="home" asp-action="Contact">Contact</a>
    thats it! no further action required - (project.assets.json already has the correct dependency
    added - obj\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers and is already included in _ViewImports.cshtml)

    specifying the controller and action is better than hard coding link in. There may be logic in the 
    action method that changes the URL of page that is displayed for example.... 

    Random Question : WHY do I need script tags on both index.cshtml and Contact.cshtml? Why cant I have it in 
    the _Layout.cs.html - needed so display name propery i.e Welcome Ted! NOT Welcome NOT SET BY JAVASCRIPT

3rd November 2018
    Bound the ContactViewModel to Contact.cshtml using the follosing line in Contact.cshtml :-
    @model CarPriceComparison.ViewModels.ContactViewModel
    also, note that the fields in the view now use the attribute/tag helper 'asp-for', which basically
    specifies what field to map to in the ViewModel 

    PLURALSIGHT - half way through 'Using Validation' lesson
    added validation to the view model. Success (see attributes in model)
    PROB : added references (jquery validation js files to contact.cshtml)
           click send email without filling any fields - expect to see validation
           <span>'s to appear. They dont
    SOLUTION : point out the fact that validation had to be added as
               <span asp-validation-for="Name"></span>
               and NOT
               <span asp-validation-for = "Name">

               otherwise validation messages do not appear!

6th November 2018
    added [HttpPost] attribute to the second implementation of HomeController.Contact
    added method=post attribute in Contact.cshtml i.e :-
    <form method="post">

    Added IMailService and injected it into HomeController so DebugMailService can be used
    Big to understand is the difference between Services.AddTransient, Services.AddScoped
    and Services.AddSingleton in Startup.ConfigureServices 

    Notice How in startup I have written
    var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                .AddJsonFile("config.json");

    Why can't this be
    ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                                .AddJsonFile("config.json") ???

    TALK about AddEnvironment Variables and how it will overwrite settings in the config.json
    file - this is useful for when deploying - IT can set environment cars easily. revisit chapter 
    'completing the form' for more on this. NOTE - I havent entered any env variables yet.

    var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                .SetBasePath(_env.ContentRootPath)
                .AddJsonFile("config.json")
                .AddEnvironmentVariables()

9th November 2018
    added ViewBag.UserMessage in home controller
    -upon succesful form submission and displayed this in the view
    - did further error check in controller (ModelState.IsValid)
    - note you can add an eror to the model state controller side if you want
    -both for a property and a summary - example gives was an AOL address
    -I didnt bother but worth demoing in vid....

10th November 2018
    commented out header, body, footer and input sections in site.js and let
    bootstrap.css take overwrite

    added bootstrap.js reference as well as bootstrap.cs (apparently needs both to
    work properly)

    added font-awesome to bower.json and added reference to _Layout.cshtml

    BROKE - header - now displays 'NOT SET BY JAVA SCRIPT'

    refactored - moved car search form to home page rather than having in header. 

15th November
    Added bootswatch to bower.json. Note unconventional versioning
    "bootswatch" : "4.1.3+3"

    the 4.1.3 is the current version of bootstrap. the + 3 is the version of bootswatch
    you want...

    - dont forget to comment out the footer styling in site.js! (bootswatch now takes care of this)

17th November
    Added a DbContext (VehicleContext.cs) after I did that
    I registered the context in Startup.ConfigureServices 

    //register the DbContext
    services.AddDbContext<VehicleContext>();

    After registration, the dbContext is injectable so I injected into
    HomeController - here it can be used to query the database.

    NOW VehicleContext.OnConfiguring needs a database connection string. Pick up again in 
    

18th November 
    Critical is creating a db to conect to. At this point in time there is a db specified in the command
    line, but this database doesnt physically exist.
    Talk about the command "dotnet ef"

21st November
    configured a one to many relationship between VehicleMake and VehicleModel by using Navigation
    properties in VehicleMake and Vehicle Model and by modifying VehicleContext :-

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity<VehicleModel>()
            .HasOne(p => p.Make)
            .WithMany(b => b.Models)
            .HasForeignKey(p => p.VehicleMakeForeignKey)
            .IsRequired()
            .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);
        }

    added vehicle makes - got up to THE END of Chevrolet

26th November.
   Introduced the repository pattern - this is a huge concept. Basically means we are not accessing
   the dbcontext directly. The repo is a sort of wrapper round the context.

   Look how the context is now injected into the controller (last parameter) :-
   public HomeController(IMailService mailService_, IConfigurationRoot config_, IVehicleRepository vehicleRepo_)

   we USED to inject the dbcontext in. now its an interface representing the repo. Interfaces can be mocked
   too for use in testing. 

   the repo is registered in startup.cs :-
   services.AddScoped<IVehicleRepository, VehicleRepository>();

27th November - added @html.dropdownlist for the vehicle make in the main view.
    Notice how the vehicle make listing is sorted in the HomeController using a simple
    LINQ expression :-

    var vehicleData = from v in _vehicleRepository.GetAllMakes()
                                  orderby v.Make
                                  select v;

28th November - Added GetModelById(int id_); method to VehicleRepository.cs
                (and a definition in IVehicleRepository.cs). This will help us
                select the correct list of models for whatever make is selected.
                Also of note is the new MakeandModelVM.cs in the Models folder.

1st December - site.js - event listner added for car make dropdown 
now sisplays alert every time the make is changed. Work in progress (goal to 
implement cascading deletes)
