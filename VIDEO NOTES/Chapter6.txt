-- added VehicleController.cs :-

public class VehicleController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet("api/vehicles")]
        public IActionResult Get()
        {
            return Ok(new VehicleMake(){Id=600, Make="Blah"});
        }
    }

NOTE you could return Json instead of IActionReuls if you wanted, but that doesnt give you a way
of returning a bad request if an exception is thrown (for example, with IActionReut you can return,
'Bad' for instance)
