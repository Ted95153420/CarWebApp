-- added VehicleController.cs :-

public class VehicleController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet("api/vehicles")]
        public IActionResult Get()
        {
            return Ok(new VehicleMake(){Id=600, Make="Blah"});
        }
    }

NOTE you could return Json instead of IActionResult if you wanted, but that doesnt give you a way
of returning a bad request if an exception is thrown (for example, with IActionReut you can return,
'Bad' for instance)

   Altered VehicleController.Get so that it retreives data from the database
   this was achieved by adding a constructor and injecting IVehicleRepository
